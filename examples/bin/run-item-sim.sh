# To run:  change into the mahout directory and type:
# ./examples/bin/run-item-sim.sh

OUTPUT="item-sim-out" # output dir for cooccurrence and cross-cooccurrence matrices
INPUT="examples/src/main/resources/cf-data-purchase.txt" # purchase actions
INPUT2="examples/src/main/resources/cf-data-view.txt" # view actions

#setup env
LOCAL=$MAHOUT-LOCAL # save state
export MAHOUT-LOCAL=true #set so the raw local file system is used

echo "This runs spark-itemsimilarity on two user actions in two intput files"
echo "The example uses fake purchases and views of products, calculating"
echo "a cooccurrence indicator for purchase and a cross-cooccurrence indicator"
echo "for view (product detail view). The example is tiny so it can be followed"
echo "with a little intuition."

# Remove old files
echo
echo "Removing old output file if it exists"
